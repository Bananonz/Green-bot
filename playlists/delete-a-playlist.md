# Delete a playlist

You can delete your playlist by typing the command: `*pl-delete name` (replace name with the playlist's name you want to delete)

You can also delete all your playlists by typing the command: `*pl-delete all`

Make sure to type the playlist name correctly otherwise the bot will say You don't have any playlist called that
